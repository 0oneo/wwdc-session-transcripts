Join Mike as he leads us through the centuries-old quest for new planets: from utilizing simple pen and paper (Neptune) to telescopic innovations (Ceres and the asteroid belt), the invention of photography (Pluto), the introduction of the first digital cameras (Eris and the Kuiper belt) to recent breakthroughs which may lead to the ability to launch a search using massive data sets from giant telescopes that are then parsed by supercomputers.

After graduating from Stanford with a degree in Mechanical Engineering and Product Design, she had firsthand knowledge of how significantly men outnumber women in science, technology, engineering and math.  Debbie then became obsessed with the notion of \"disrupting the pink aisle\" with a toy that would introduce girls to the joy of engineering at a young age.  Industry leaders told her the idea would fail, but less than three years after launching GoldieBlox on Kickstarter, she has made significant strides in her quest to bridge the gender gap in STEM:  she has launched massively successful viral videos, a Superbowl ad that brought mainstream awareness to her mission, an award-winning iOS app and GoldieBlox presence in more than 6,000 retail stores worldwide.  Debbie has also recently been selected to join the Presidential Ambassadors for Global Entrepreneurship, a select group 'committed to helping develop the next generation of entrepreneurs around the world.'
